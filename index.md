My name is Ethan Tracey, and I am a junior at the University of Connecticut studying for a B.S. in Physics. The field of Physics that I am currently invested in is Quantum Information Science. I have experience in developing a curriculum and teaching it to students, specifically with Hartford Public High School through the University of Connecticut Sceince Technology and Astronomy Recruits club (STARs).
